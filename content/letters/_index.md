Sometimes it's hard to say everything in the moment.  So we write.  

These are our letters to you, Meera — to remember your growing days, to hold the small magic in words, and to leave you little footprints of love for later.  Someday, when you're older, you can read them. For now, we write with soft hearts and sleepy eyes.
