We are **Aai** (me) and **Baba** ‚Äî two new-ish parents navigating the beautiful mess of early parenthood, one chai cup and cuddle at a time. And at the center of it all is Meera, our wide-eyed, 10-month-old spark of joy and mischief.

This space ‚Äî *Meera ani Mi* ‚Äî began as a quiet little idea: To write down the things we might forget, but don‚Äôt want to.

The soft sighs after naps,  
The squeals when she sees the moon,  
The little fists full of marigold petals.  
Moments that fill our hearts and vanish too quickly.

Here, we gather those moments.  
Not for the world, but maybe for her.  
And maybe a little for us too.

### Why this blog?
We wanted something more personal than just a phone gallery.  
Something that felt slower, more thoughtful.  
Something that could grow alongside her.

You‚Äôll find:
- Tiny stories from our day-to-day life
- Letters written to Meera (or to ourselves)
- Family memories, milestones, and mischief

Sometimes in English.  
Sometimes in [Marathi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathi_language).  
Always from the heart.

### For Meera
One day, you might read this, Meera.  
We hope you‚Äôll feel how much you were loved ‚Äî in every ordinary moment.

Until then, we‚Äôll keep writing.  
With sleepy eyes and full hearts.

If you're reading this and smiling ‚Äî welcome.  
We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here.

üå∏ With love,  
**Aai, and Baba**
